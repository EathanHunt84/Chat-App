# Real-Time Chat Application

Welcome to the **Real-Time Chat Application** built with **Flask**, **Flask-SocketIO**, and **JavaScript**. This web app allows users to join the chat with a unique username, send messages, and receive them in real-time. It's designed for easy deployment and usage on both desktop and mobile devices.

---

## 📌 Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Chat messages are broadcasted to all connected users instantly.
- **User Join**: Users can join the chat with a unique username.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices.

---

## 📋 Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python's package installer)

---

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-app.git
cd chat-app
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Frontend dependencies:
The app uses **Socket.IO** via CDN, so no additional frontend setup is needed.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application (locally)

Start the application by running the following command in your project directory:

```bash
python run.py
```

Your Flask app will now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Open this URL in your browser to start using the chat app.

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. User Joins:
- The user enters a username and clicks the **"JOIN"** button.
- The app establishes a WebSocket connection via **Socket.IO**, and the `user_join` event is emitted with the username.

### 2. Sending and Receiving Messages:
- Users can type messages and press **Enter** to send them.
- Messages are broadcast to all connected clients in real-time, displayed in the chat interface.

### 3. Backend:
- The Flask server uses **Flask-SocketIO** to handle WebSocket connections.
- The server listens for the `user_join` event, storing usernames with corresponding session IDs.
- The server also listens for `new_message` events, broadcasting messages to all clients.

## 📜 Requirements

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies for the project:

- **Flask**
- **Flask-SocketIO**

Install them using:

```bash
pip install flask flask-socketio
```

Or, install all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📝 Notes

- The app runs on port `8000`. You can change this in the `run.py` file if needed.
- The app uses **Socket.IO** to facilitate real-time communication between the server and clients.
- All chat messages are broadcast to all connected users in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- **Authentication**: Secure user login and authentication.
- **Private Messaging**: Allow users to send private messages.
- **Message History**: Save chat messages and display them when users join.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for connection failures and invalid messages.
